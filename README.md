# auTO

**auTO** (pronounced *[Otto](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:Silent_Wolf)*) is a Discord bot for
running Melee netplay tournaments by calling matches and reporting results.

auTO can only manage tournaments ran through [Challonge](https://challonge.com) due to its more
comprehensive API compared to smash.gg's.

## Features
* List active matches.
* Ping players when it's time for them to play.
* Mark matches as in progress when players post netplay codes in the chat.
* Players can report their own matches without going through the TO.

## Setup

TODO: Provide link to invite auTO to their server.

## How to Use

* `/auTO start [URL]` - Start TOing the given Challonge bracket.
* `/auTO stop` - Stop TOing.
* `/auTO matches` - Print current matches.
* `/auTO report 0-2` - Report your match.

## Developing
